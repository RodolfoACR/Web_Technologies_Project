# Introduction
In this course project, students will work in groups of up to 3 people, regardless of their section, to design and implement a web application using Ruby on Rails. The goal is to create a simplified social platform centered on image sharing, inspired by applications such as Pinterest (without using that name or branding). The main purpose of this project is to help students put into practice the concepts learned in class by developing a functional, interactive, and visually appealing web app that focuses on content sharing and basic user interaction.

# Project Overview
The web application you will develop throughout this course aims to replicate the essential features of an image-based social platform. Users will be able to create an account and log in securely, ensuring their data is protected through a robust authentication system. Once authenticated, users can upload images, each accompanied by a short description and a set of relevant hashtags. These hashtags will play a key role in the application’s search and filtering functionalities, allowing users to discover and explore content related to their interests.

The platform should support basic social interactions. Users must be able to like photos and leave comments, encouraging engagement and interaction among users. This interactive component is fundamental to the overall user experience and reflects the core functionality of modern social platforms.

Additionally, the application must include a user profile page. Each user should have a public profile where their uploaded images are displayed, along with basic information such as their username and a summary of their activity (e.g., number of posts or total likes received). This feature is intended to give more depth to the social aspect of the platform, allowing users to view and explore others' contributions more meaningfully.

A search bar or filtering tool should be implemented to help users browse content by hashtags. The application’s user interface (UI) should be intuitive and visually appealing, presenting the uploaded content in an organized layout that promotes ease of navigation and content discovery. Visual clarity, responsiveness, and a consistent design language are key.

From a technical perspective, the application must be built using Ruby on Rails as the primary development framework. You are expected to apply the architectural principles and tools studied in class, including the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, RESTful routing, and the use of partials and layouts to create a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase.

In essence, this project challenges you to combine creativity and technical knowledge to build a meaningful, functional, and user-friendly application that showcases your understanding of modern web development practices.
